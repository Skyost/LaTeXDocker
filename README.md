# skyost/latex-docker

This is a personal Docker image that I use in my Github actions.

## What's included ?

It's based on `texlive/texlive` and it mainly includes the following tools.

* [TeXLive](https://hub.docker.com/r/texlive/texlive).
* [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).
* [pdftocairo](https://poppler.freedesktop.org/).

I use it to build my websites based on their LaTeX content (see [Mes cours de maths](https://mes-cours-de-maths.fr/cours/troisieme/fonctions/), [agreg.skyost.eu](https://agreg.skyost.eu/developpements/caracterisation-reelle-de-gamma/), [Bacomathiques](https://bacomathiqu.es/cours/terminale/nombres-complexes)).

But it also includes [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/).
