# skyost/latex-docker

This is a personal Docker image that I use on my Github actions. It mainly includes the following tools.

* [TeXLive](https://hub.docker.com/r/texlive/texlive).
* [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).
* [Poppler](https://poppler.freedesktop.org/).

But it also includes Git and NodeJS.
